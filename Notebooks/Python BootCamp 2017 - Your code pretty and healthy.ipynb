    "\n",
    "If one writes a code that it is not easy to install, easy to run, easily read and easily debuged, the chances that this code falls in the void are very high. Even when we are sure that we will be the only ones that will use this piece of code, if we don't do it properly the chances that we will have to write the code again are also very high.\n",

    "There are a lot of people (and probably the reader is one of these) that think that a readable-well-documented code is important but does not actually write codes like that, because... well... you know... it is just a draft of a script... I will use it only once... and I **do not want to waste time writing more lines to make it clearer**.\n",

    "Python was developed for fast development. It is not a very efficient language if one thinks in terms of computational processing but it is much faster to write a code and implement an idea in Python than in any other language. Python was also created thinking on sharing this ideas so why people are still not writing clear codes? Why people still waste their time writing and repeating and re-inventing the wheel when there are tons of codes around there? \n",
